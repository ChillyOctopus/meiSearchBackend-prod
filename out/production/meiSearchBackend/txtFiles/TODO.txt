GENERAL:
    - We often get the "unable to find <layer>" error. This is because the mei doesn't always use the closing
    tag of '/layer>', but sometimes just '/>'. Build a state machine that tracks open tags and closing tags
    inside of general parser, and maybe use that for our parsing logic instead.

    - We are currently getting this (non-fatal) error, enclosed in triple quotes below:

"""
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-16-250 scripts]$ ./indexDatabase
/home/ec2-user/meiSearchBackend/src/workers/ElasticProcessor.java:17: error: package org.apache.http.impl.nio.reactor does not exist
import org.apache.http.impl.nio.reactor.IOReactorConfig;
                                       ^

                        ^
  class file for org.apache.http.impl.nio.reactor.IOReactorConfig not found
"""

    we should probably do something about it, but it doesn't seem to be breaking anything. When we open the org.apache.http.impl.nio
    section of the httpasyncclient-4.1.5.jar, it does not show a 'reactor' subfolder, which is likely part of the issue. Intellij
    says that the documentation for this and for the .setDefaultIOReactorConfig is from that jar however.

    - So we have work to do concerning actual rests, especially when they comprise the entire measure. And ties.

    - Also the randomly generated xml id's sometimes match your string finds, so you need to double-check those, like in ALL of your parsers

    - Parse a piece of music into timing vectors as well. Our program assumes currently that the tied notes are one note,
and that no other notes come in between them.

    - Ties are your enemy currently - You need to ensure that accidentals on tied
notes across measure lines are kept. Each Note perhaps can have a Note object that
serves as the ending Note that is tied to, or maybe each Note has a Note that is
the beginning of its tie. Or both notes could have each other as the tie... If you
don't have a Note in the tied section, you aren't part of a tie!

    - Log how many times and when you are using the defaults when you use your parsedData object

    - Write parsers and classes for layers and staffs, add functionality beyond what you have for that.

    - Extrapolate out the highlighter and more for the queries
